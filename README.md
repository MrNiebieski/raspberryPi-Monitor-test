# raspberryPi-Monitor-test #

A web server that combines raspberry pi camera module and GPIO control.

This is intended to have a web-server that serves a page that has live camera image that monitor a LED. The user can turn the LED on and off by clicking a button on the web page while monitoring it with the camera.

I used the code for camera module from [miguelgrinberg.com](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask)

and the code for GPIO control from [mattrichardson.com](http://mattrichardson.com/Raspberry-Pi-Flask/)

I acknowledge their credit for this work.

However, this code still have some issues.
